It serves as a health some alternative to processed white flour.Our Oats flour is slowly digested by the body. It is an excellent source of fiber, making it a great digestive aid. It has a rich content of vitamins, minerals and other beneficial plant compounds.In a bowl, mix oats powder, cumin seeds and salt. Add water till the oats achieve a thin consistency. The batter must be slightly thinner than your average Idli batter. Grease a dish and add the batter to the dish. Take a big vessel with water and heat the water. Place the dish with the batter inside and cover the vessel. Let the Khichu steam for 5-7 Minutes. When you lift the lid, if the khichu has risen then it is cooked and ready to eat. Take if off the heat and relish it with a mix of oil, chilly powder and a pinch of salt.Roast the oats in a pan and then crush them till they have formed a fine powder. Add grated carrots to the oats powder along with salt and curd. In a frying pan, heat some oil and sputter mustard seeds, urad dal, chana dal, curry leaves and green chillies. Add this mixture to the idli batter. Mix the batter well and let it be of a thick consistency (like an idli batter). Grease the idli pan and steam the idlis till they are cooked.

Once the seeds crackle, add the urad dal and roast till the dal turns a golden brown. Then add some curry leaves, salt, turmeric and onions and saute till the onions turn translucent. Add chopped carrots and peas and cook for about a minute till the carrots turn slightly soft. Add salt, top with bell peppers and once you feel your oats are almost cooked, add this vegetable mixture to the oats and cook for about a minute.This method retains the crispiness of the vegetables as they are semi-cooked. If you like your vegetables well boiled, then add the oats mixture to the vegetable mixture and then add the water and bring to a boil.",NA," Organic oat flour has so many uses, especially in cooking. It can be used as a thickener for sauces and gravy, giving it a silkier and creamier texture.

It gives a feeling of fullness when taken as a snack and prevents overeating thereby helping in weight loss. Makhana is beneficial for overall skin health (wrinkles and signs of aging) due to the presence of antioxidants and certain amino acids that have anti-aging property.According to Ayurveda, Makhana helps improve male health as it increases sperm quality and quantity due to its aphrodisiac property.Inspired by the natural ingredients found in our grandmother's kitchen, we at Nutty Yogi are commitment to provide good and wholesome food for every home.

, The milk is removed by hand then boiled to make curd. The whole curd is churned with a wooden churner in traditional method, the butter obtained from this method then turned into pure ghee through slow heating process.  
, Hand churned cow ghee is proven beneficial for the body by Ayurveda. The consumption of ghee offers a wide range of benefits, including clarity of mind and improves Immunity. Because of its high smoke point (250C or 482F), ghee is one of the best to use in cooking since it won’t break down into free radicals like others  
, It is made by a simple process of gently simmering butter to remove potential allergens such as casein and lactose.  
, The type of saturated fat that Desi Ghee has is the short-chain-fatty acid. This helps to burn the stubborn fat in the body while regulating your metabolism. Good for your heart: Vitamin K2 found in desi ghee helps in preventing calcium deposits in the arteries that can lead to blockages and obstruct blood flow. It lowers bad cholesterol levels and increases good cholesterol levels, thus maintaining a healthy balance.
