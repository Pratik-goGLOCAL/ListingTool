Deep Rooted Values. And A Healthier You.Ayurveda is a rich tradition that goes back to thousands of years. We all have witnessed the miracles of ayurveda in our juvenile age when our elders used various natural ingredients from their backyard to safeguard us from various lifestyle problems. The story of AADAR goes back to three decades when a grandmother (also a vaidya) devised few ayurveda formulations using all natural herbs to tackle issues such as indigestion, blood sugar etc. in the family. Years passed by, but her creations stayed, until one day her grandson self-realized its benefits and the importance of such home grown solutions for wellness. That is when “AADAR” was born with the motive to bring such ayurveda inspired products to the modern consumer; products which are becoming more and more relevant for today’s fast paced life. All AADAR products are Natural, Vegan and Cruelty Free. Today AADAR works with women cooperative organizations to give back to society and bring such hidden secrets to the masses.Have you tried everything in your capacity to get your blood sugar levels in control, but haven’t succeeded?

Regular use of Jeevani will keep your sugar levels in control.Aloe Vera and Neem are the main active ingredient in Jeevani. Aloe Vera is well known to promote proper digestion and helps remove toxins from the system, thus enhancing metabolism and detoxification. Neem, on the other hand, acts as a blood purifier and has antimicrobial properties. Moreover, some recent findings published in Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine suggest that taking aloe vera on a regular basis can significantly help manage the level of glucose in the blood.The efficacy of Jeevani and its sustained benefits in controlling the blood glucose levels is now supported by various medical practitioners to help people looking for safe and natural approach to manage blood sugar.

Jeevani is an effective ayurvedic formulation devised to control this epidemic by cleansing the system from within and enhancing the metabolism and immunity.After years of research and validation, we have been successful in sharing our so called “Dadi ke Nuskhe” with the world.
